I took on the Anambra Techies challenge to
recreate [this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emaike_ui-interaction-movieapp-activity-7297223525805809664-Ousp)
UI interaction. Any stack was allowed so I went with Jetpack Compose!

### Tech Stack:

- Jetpack Compose – for the entire UI
- GIFs – from [Google's Noto Emoji](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/)
- Images – sourced from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1175942-the-bad-guys-2)
- Coil – for smooth GIF rendering ([Coil GIFs]((https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/gifs/)))

### What I Learned

This project pushed me to experiment with Canvas for custom drawing and Layout for precise
composable positioning. I explored different animation techniques, played around with sharedElements
and sharedBounds, and had a blast bringing it all together.
A fun challenge with tons of learning along the way!
